# Equation-Solver
The Equation Solver is a Python class designed to solve various types of mathematical equations, including quadratic, simultaneous linear, cubic, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric equations.

  ## Features

- Solves quadratic equations of the form \(ax<sub>2</sub> + bx + c = 0\).
- Solves systems of two simultaneous linear equations with two variables.
- Solves systems of three simultaneous linear equations with three variables.
- Solves cubic polynomial equations of the form \(ax<sub>3</sub> + bx<sub>2</sub> + cx + d = 0\).
- Solves exponential equations of the form \(a<sub>x</sub> = b\).
- Solves logarithmic equations of the form \(\log_a(x) = b\).
- Solves trigonometric equations of the form \(\sin(x) = \text{value}\), \(\cos(x) = \text{value}\), and \(\tan(x) = \text{value}\).
