# Equation-Solver
The Equation Solver is a Python class designed to solve various types of mathematical equations, including quadratic, simultaneous linear, cubic, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric equations.

# Features
* Solves quadratic equations of the form ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0
* a<sup>2</sup>x

  ## Features

- Solves quadratic equations of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).
- Solves systems of two simultaneous linear equations with two variables.
- Solves systems of three simultaneous linear equations with three variables.
- Solves cubic polynomial equations of the form \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\).
- Solves exponential equations of the form \(a^x = b\).
- Solves logarithmic equations of the form \(\log_a(x) = b\).
- Solves trigonometric equations of the form \(\sin(x) = \text{value}\), \(\cos(x) = \text{value}\), and \(\tan(x) = \text{value}\).
